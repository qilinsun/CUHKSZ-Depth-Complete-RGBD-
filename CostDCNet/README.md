# CostDCNet

This repository contains the accompanying code for "CostDCNet: Cost Volume based Depth Completion for a Single RGB-D Image, ECCV'22"

## Overview

Successful depth completion from a single RGB-D image requires both extracting plentiful 2D and 3D features and merging these heterogeneous features appropriately. 
We propose a novel depth completion framework, CostDCNet, based on the cost volume-based depth estimation approach that has been successfully employed for multi-view stereo (MVS). 
The key to high-quality depth map estimation in the approach is constructing an accurate cost volume. To produce a quality cost volume tailored to single-view depth completion, we present a simple but effective architecture that can fully exploit the 3D information, three options to make an RGB-D feature volume, and a per-plane pixel shuffle for efficient volume upsampling.
Our framework consists of lightweight (~1.8M parameters) deep neural networks, running in real time (~30ms). Nevertheless, thanks to our simple but effective design, CostDCNet demonstrates depth completion results comparable to or better than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 18.06 or higher
- CUDA 11.1 or higher
- pytorch 1.8 or higher
- python 3.8 or higher


### Environment Setup (Anaconda)
We recommend using Anaconda
```
conda create -n costDCNet python==3.8.12
conda activate costDCNet
conda install openblas-devel -c anaconda
conda install pytorch==1.8.0 torchvision==0.9.0 torchaudio==0.8.0 cudatoolkit=11.1 -c pytorch -c conda-forge
